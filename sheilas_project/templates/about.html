            <h2 class="text-center">MyDogCat Animal Centre</h2>
            <p class="lee"> The institution was founded by Sir Robert Harrold, a Canadian Ambassador in Kenya, in 2015.
                His love for animals was expressed when he joined hands with Mr Arnold Ambenge, current manager
                of the MyDogCat Animal Centre, to develop this institution. Only five dogs had been rescued before
                introduction of cat rescue in late 2017. So far the institution has grown to what it currently
                is now.</p>

            <h3>Animal rescue</h3>
            <p class="lee">The institution currently has about 40 employees excluding the executive board. About 20 of
                the employees are dedicated to travelling within the city with the purpose of animal rescue.
                <br>Animal rescue involves saving dogs abd cats of all types and ages from extreme or difficult
                situations they may be in. Such situtaions include injuries, illnesses, abandonment, entrapment
                amongst others. These animals are immediately delivered to the institution and quarantined until medical
                check-up, vaccination amongst other things are performed on them. This
                is to ensure they are able to interact safely with the other animals. </p>

            <h3>Animal shelter</h3>
            <p class="lee">The institution has been able to set up several buildings which include kennels, litter
                boxes, etc. Such an environment has given the rescued animals a chance to grow and live comfortably
                as required. The animal shelters are cleaned, disinfected and decorated by dedicated employees in charge
                of feeding, playing and keeping check on all the animals in the institution.
                <br>Inspection is done monthly on the shelters to ensure there is proper maintenance done.</p>

            <h3>Animal Training</h3>
            <p class="lee">This luxury is not performed on every animal. However, certain types, eg the german shepherd,
                require a bit of training due to their wild energy. The training privilege is extended
                to customers who wish to have their animals trained. Training is done within the institution for a
                certain period of time. Purchasing, nonetheless, is required to be done before
                any training is done.</p>

            <h3>Animal adoption</h3>
            <p class="lee">Animal adoption is cherished most within the institution. Not only is it the main source of
                income but also is an opportunity for customers to fall in love with one or more of the lovely animals
                within the institution. Interaction woth these animals is important since detailed information about
                each of them is given before finalizing the adoption. An agreement form is required to be
                signed to show full dedication in taking care of them. Dog and Cat fairs are done twice within a year to
                ensure maximum publicity of the to-be pets. </p>
